Scala translations of Forbus and de Kleer's implementations of
truth-maintenance systems and other code from their *Building Problem
Solvers* book.

Curently there are two working translations:

 - Standalone justification-based truth maintenence systems.

 - Standalone assumption-based truth maintenence systems.

There are partial/in-progress translations of combined justification-
and assumption-based truth maintenence systems and rule engines (in
the `jtms` and `atms` branches of the repository).
