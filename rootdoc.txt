Scala translations of Forbus and de Kleer's implementations of
truth-maintenance systems and other code from their *Building Problem
Solvers* book.

Curently there is only one working translation:

 - Standalone justification-based truth maintenence systems.

There are partial/in-progress translations of

 - Combined justification-based truth maintenence systems and rule
   engines (in the `jtms` branch of the repository).

 - Standalone assumption-based truth maintenence systems (in the
   `atms` branch of the repository).
