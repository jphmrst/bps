# bps-scala â€” truth maintenance systems for Scala

This repository is a translation from Common Lisp to Scala of 
the truth maintenance systems and other tools from Forbus and
de Kleer's _Building Problem Solvers_.

The current version includes working versions of the justification-
and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).  There
is a partial translation of the rule engine wrapper for these TMSes,
and of logic based TMSes (LTMSes).

To contribute, submit pull requests to one of the branches `atms`,
`jtms` or `ltms`, or start a new branch for one of the other BPS
tools, at [its repository](https://github.com/jphmrst/bps-scala).
