# bps-scala â€” truth maintenance systems for Scala

This repository is a translation from Common Lisp to Scala (in
progress) of the truth maintenance systems and other tools from Forbus
and de Kleer's _Building Problem Solvers_.

The current version includes working versions of the
justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance
systems (JTMS and ATMS).  There is a partial translation
of the rule engine wrapper for these TMSes.

To contribute, push changes to one of the two branches `atms` or
`jtms`, or start a new branch for one of the other BPS tools.
