# Truth maintenance system libraries for Scala and Haskell

This repository is a translations from Common Lisp to
Scala and to Haskell of the truth maintenance systems
and other tools from Forbus and de Kleer's _Building
Problem Solvers_ (BPS).

The current version includes working versions of the
justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance
systems (JTMS and ATMS) in Scala.  There is a partial
translation of the rule engine wrapper for these TMSes.

Currently in branches, there are in-progress translations
of the JTMS to Haskell, and the LTMS to Scala.
