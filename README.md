# bps-scala â€” truth maintenance systems for Scala

This repository is a translation from Common Lisp of the truth
maintenance systems and other tools from Forbus and de Kleer's
_Building Problem Solvers_ into both Scala and Haskell.

The current version includes working versions of the justification-
and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS) in
Scala, and JTMSes in Haskell.  There is a partial translation of the
rule engine wrapper for these TMSes in Scala.

To contribute, submit pull requests to one of the three branches
`atms` (Scala), `jtms` (Scala) or `haskell` (both JTMS and ATMS), or
start a new branch for one of the other BPS tools, at 
[its repository](https://github.com/jphmrst/bps-scala).
