# bps-scala â€” truth maintenance systems for Scala

This repository is a translation from Common Lisp to Scala (in
progress) of the truth maintenance systems and other tools from Forbus
and de Kleer's _Building Problem Solvers_.

The current version includes a working version of the
justification-based truth maintenance system (JTMS), and a
not-yet-functional partial translation of the rule engine wrapper for
JTMSes.

To contribute, push changes to one of the two branches `atms` or
`jtms`, or start a new branch for one of the other BPS tools.
